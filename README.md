# cs50_final_project
Hi and welcome to my final cs50 project. 

This project is all about fitness. I have created a website in which user can login and select differnet workouts and enters the reps and wieghts which will be uplaoed to the sql database. There is even a booking caleneder system in which you can book different times in for when you want to workout 

---Geting Started--- 
In order to get the program running I suggest downloading the xampp software. And make sure to donwload the sql and apache features.,
After downaload the repo and place all elements into htdocs file. 

Then on the broswer click the very top and type in 'localhost' 

NOTE: In order program to work please make sure to rename the defalut index.php to something different. Further once on localhost click login_page.php to start the program 
--Importing sql db--
In order to import the db please extract the test.sql zip. 
once extracted go to the localhost/phpmyadmin or go to the xampp app and click on admin next to mysql .
Once on webpage look for the db that says test at the bottom lefthand side. Once clicked on the main window at the topnav bar click import. Then where it says choose file is where you will import the db file from repo!!!!(this must be done or program will break)!!!


NOTE: This project was created very early on in my code carrer thereofore don't judge the desgin or nature of the program :)
